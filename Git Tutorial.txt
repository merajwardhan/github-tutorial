Git can show version information, like if you save a code on git. it saves various versions of that code. so in future you can revisit 
the prior code if you want to undo change or revive something.

GIT USING POWERSHELL/COMMAND PROMPT (Command prompt instructions)

Step 0 = IMP (if you ever close the  command line/powershell then you will have to reset the directory because it will be set to home 
         directory again by default
Step 1 = Open powershell and the command prompt directory will be set to home directory. so we have to change directory
Step 2 = " cd C:\Users\patil\Desktop\Git_Tut" we gave the path of the directory that we want our Git application to check folder.
         here, cd (change directory)
Step 3 = (optional) "ls" give ls command , which is list files and folders in the *current folder
Step 4 = Set up git in the folder that we have set our change directory. to do that pass "Git init" in the command line
         (after this command, Git is now tracking all the files in this folder for changes.
